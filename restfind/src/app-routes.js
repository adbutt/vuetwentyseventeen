 * Note: Turning on the HTML5 History Mode with "mode: 'history'" will eliminate the '#' in the URLs. However, as we're loading Vue on a Custom Page Template, the main routing is still handled by WordPress. As a result a page refresh of directly loading a Vue specific link will return 404 Not Found.
 * With the '#' in the URL the Vue specific link will work as regular link.
 * e.g.
 * http://wpvue.test/search-page/#/videos will work directly or even on page refresh but
 * http://wpvue.test/search-page/videos will not as WordPress will try to look for it.
